# ufc_analysis
Analysis of the UFC dataset which is originally from https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata.
The modelling is done is to predict the probability that the Red corner fighter from the dataset is the winner.
Because most of the parameters from the dataset are cumulative they were not of much use, hence the notebook focuses on trying to determine if physical attributes and rounds fought can be good predictors of the winner.
